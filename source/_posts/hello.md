I've been active on the web for over twenty-five years in a variety of ephemeral forms. My myriad projects and websites have launched and shutdown, scattered as the sands of time in a fickle breeze. While my own final extinguishment may be equally abrupt and unceremonious some day, I aspire to a more indelible contribution to our world.

So I begin again. Undaunted by the empirical evidence of my past efforts and constant refrain of the echoing self-doubt which mercilessly nags me into a foggy and weary return to the status quo, I launch this website and I am reborn.

*Why?*

<!-- more -->

Something I have witnessed in myself, over many years now, is that I am full of many independent and seemingly mutually exclusive ideas all convincing me to care about them. I have difficulty staying with any single premise/plan/project for more than a couple of weeks. I used to think it was simply that I am too easily bored or distracted, but what I have learned is that my attention is actually cyclic, perhaps comporting to a kind of psychological biorhythm.

The problem, of course, with this way-of-being, is that the cycle is long and my homecomings are filled with a sense of estrangement. Progress on my myriad of great plans is effectively short and perpetually stymied because of the difficulty in gathering the necessary momentum to reach escape velocity on any one project.

My plan to solve for this is to change my approach of compartmentalizing all of these into their own worlds and, instead, merge as many of them as possible into a singular work. In this way, with every point of interest mapped onto the wheel's edge, no matter what my attention turns to, the proverbial rubber will still meet the road.

I take as inspiration, for the recognition of the cyclic and connected nature of the facets of my consciousness, Alchemical concepts such as the "The Rotation of the Elements" and the stages of the Alchemical Process of Transformation in the production of the "Magnum Opus" or "Great Work".

This site is not intended to *be* my Magnum Opus, but rather a doorway for me to enter into it and to open and share my journey with you. Welcome!
